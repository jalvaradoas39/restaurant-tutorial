# Restaurant Tutorial

[Restaurant Tutorial](https://restaurant-tutorial.herokuapp.com/) is a full-stack e-commerce project that showcases an online shopping platform. This project was created as part of a YouTube tutorial series aimed at teaching others how to build an e-commerce site from scratch.

The focus of the tutorial series was on implementing essential e-commerce functionality rather than designing a visually polished UI, to keep the series concise. The application includes features such as search filters, shopping cart functionality, secure payment processing, and admin dashboard tools for managing products.

You can watch the full tutorial series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WebStoreMaker).

## About the Project

This project was created as a result of my passion for teaching others what I've learned. I have learned so much from instructors on platforms like YouTube, so it feels rewarding to return the favor to the community in the best way possible. The tutorial series on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WebStoreMaker) guides viewers step-by-step through building an application with features like:

- Search filters.
- Shopping cart functionality.
- Payment gateway integration using **Stripe**.
- Admin dashboard functionality for managing products and inventory.

The focus of the series was on **functionality** rather than UI design, as I wanted to ensure the tutorial series didn't overextend in time. The tutorials emphasize practical skills and real-world problem-solving to help aspiring developers learn and grow.

## What I Learned

While creating the YouTube tutorial series, I worked on this restaurant online ordering application using **React** on the frontend and **Express**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB** on the backend.

During development, I encountered a **proxy error** while writing the code to display food items on the homepage. After researching the issue on Google and StackOverflow, I discovered it was a common error among developers. I created a dedicated YouTube video explaining the steps to resolve the issue, which became one of my most viewed videos in the tutorial series.

Through this project, I also learned to build an e-commerce site using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**, implementing features such as:
- Search filters.
- Shopping cart functionality.
- Payment gateway integration with **Stripe**.
- Admin dashboard functionality for managing products.
- Debugging and improving the development workflow.

This project deepened my understanding of full-stack development and enhanced my ability to teach complex concepts effectively.
